# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## onload
 the user gets to see the qoutes whatever the database has and then the
 post ui is what would be the main focus 
 there would be a input field and a button 
 so that way the user puts the qoute in the database >> 

  to show the qoutes i can use an useState of array and use the useEffect hook for the side effect 
  
  putting a qoute inthe database wpuld be in another page like post Page >>
  so the pages are home page and post page >>
  '/' routes to the home page and 
  '/post' routes the user to the post page >
  [task] lets first make this by simple useStates and then try recoil and then try redux>>
   
  recoil >> 
  there is something called atom and i can use call its value anywhere by
